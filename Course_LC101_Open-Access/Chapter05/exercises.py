The two spirals in this picture differ only by the turn angle. Draw both.

Note: Because this program might receive a TimeLimitError weâ€™ve added some code to our answer to 
make the turtle go faster (use its speed method) and to increase the time the program is allowed 
to run to 35 seconds. You can do the latter in your code using:
