			<h1>My Story</h1>
			<hr />
			<h2 id="growing_up">Growing Up</h2>
			<p>I was born and raised in Kansas City, Kansas. My father is a salesman and manager at a local clothing store and 
			my mother is a retired administrative assistant for the Wyandotte County District Courts. I have one younger sister 
			and no cousins. My mother was born and raised in Kansas City, Kansas while my father was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
			<p>I played organized soccer and basketball growing up. I was on my school athletic teams, league teams at the local YMCA and 
			played with two different AAU basketball teams. Basketball was my preferred sport, but soccer was always fun and enjoyable.</p>

				<p>After a long career in Human Resources, I want to change my professional focus to programming and/or data analysis. It&#39;s always been part 
				of the work that I&#39;ve done, but I want to make Information Technology my main focus and responsibility. I love solving problems and finding 
				solutions to various problems and enjoy breaking things down to build them back up again.</p>

			<h2 id="family">Family</h2>
				<h3>My Family</h3>
				<p>I have been married to my amazing wife for over 5 years. We first met almost seven years ago.</p>
				<p>Together we have two boys, ages 3 and 1.</p>
				<h3>Parents &amp; In-Laws</h3>
				<p>My parents and my in-laws all live here in the Kansas City area.</p>
				<h3>Extended Family</h3>
				<p>I'm lucky enough to have an extended family of cousins, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews (both official and unofficial) in the Kansas City area and in other parts of the country.</p>

			<h2>Some Places I Have Visited</h2>
			<article>
				<h3>New York City, NY</h3>
				<p>My best friend lives in the New York area, so I&#39;ve made multiple trips to the &quot;Big Apple.&quot; Central Park, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and more can be found in 
				New York. Even after multiple trips, I haven&#39;t been able to see it all. The city is changing constantly and there are so many things to do both within the city and in the surrounding
				areas.</p>

				<h3>Golden, CO</h3>
				<p>Home to multiple breweries, Golden is a nice little town that my wife and I visited for our anniversary. We didn&#39;t go during ski season, unfortunately, but the town
				was very nice and we were able to kick back and relax for several days while enjoying the countryside.</p>

				<h3>San Francisco, CA</h3>
				<p>San Francisco is a busy city with lots to do. I've been lucky enough to make a couple of side-trips there while traveling for work. From seeing the architecture to the Golden Gate
				Bridge to the infamous Alcatraz, there is no shortage of landmarks and activities.</p>

				<h3>Myrtle Beach, SC</h3>
				<p>I visited Myrtle Beach once with some friends. It is a fun destination with beaufiul beaches.</p>

				<h3>Chicago, IL</h3>
				<p>I've made several trips to Chicago. It's a great town: from 
				the "Magnificent Mile" to State Street and Navy Pier, there's 
				always something to do. Downtown Chicago is easy to navigate and you can walk most places. During warmer weather,
				trollies and other free transportation are also available. You can visit the Field Museum, Adler Observatory and more!</p>

			<article>
				<h3>St. Louis, MO</h3>
				<p>I had family in the St. Louis area growing up, so we would make regular trips to the &quot;Gateway to the West.&quot; I still have many friends who live in St. Louis. The 
				greater metropolitan area is huge and the city is very enthusiastic about the Cardinals.</p>

				<h3>Keystone, SD</h3>
				<p>My family and I took an extended road trip when I was younger, driving through a variety of destinations. Mt. Rushmore was incredible to see in person.</p>

			<article>
				<h3>Las Vegas, NV</h3>
				<p>Located in southern Nevada, Las Vegas is known for its many casinos and resorts. I&#39;ve been to Las Vegas many times for both work and leisure. When I was younger,
				 there was a basketball tournament that we would play in each year. The city changes extremely fast with new buildings going up seemingly daily.</p>
